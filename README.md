# Rice
This is my personal rice of Arch

## What you will need
1 - Obviously you will need an arch based OS, if you use the arch-istall its easier because you can already choose the correct tiling window manager.

2 - The i3 dynamic tiling window manager which is availaible to install also here -> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/i3

3 - A lot of pacience :)
